My dream is to become the best devops engineer in the world.
All i need to do is work hard, study, build my confidence
pray and believe and i will conquer every whether
I know that it will be possible. 
Later on i will buy properties everywhere and be very wealthy
So help me God.
Amen.
Dreams do come true. And like i said i believe it so, that is how it will turn out for me
If by september i do not get a job then before the end of october 1st, i will get it.
That is how strong my faith is.
its with the same faith that i believe that at the end of the day, i will be leaving this country
with every member of my family, because my very first job will open the way for us. amen
If i were given the opportunity to choose, i will choose North America, USA or Canada
